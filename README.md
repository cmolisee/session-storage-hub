### Basic Usage

See the [usage](USAGE.md) documentation on how to use this extension.

## Architecture

This extension is built primarily with react, typescript, and sass.

Chrome api's are used extensively for browser, tab, and storage functionality and interaction.

The extension injects a service worker ('background.js') via the manifest file to each webpage in order to read and write session storage data for each tab. Communication between the service worker and the extension is handled by the content script.

All necessary files are minified and pacakged into the build folder.
